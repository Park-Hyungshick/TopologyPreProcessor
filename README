This is the startup project of TPPMKTOP utility for generating molecular
dynamic topology directly from the chemical structure file.

There are two working programs now:

* TPPRENUM

tpprenum renumerate molecule using the longest tail algorithm. Some branched
molecules are numerated with *tpprenum* well. Highly connected molecules (such
as graphene layer or fullerene) could not be renumbered by this algorythm.

* TPPMKTOP

This utility uses SMARTS patterns defined in the Database to attribute atoms in
structure with corresponding correct atomtypes of the force field. The rest
interactions (bonded and non-bonded) are generated further according to
attributing atomtypes.

TPPMKTOP/TPPRENUM are now located at the website:

about usage of tppmktop or collaboration, etc.
